Initial version
This will just be a POS system for an isolated rental facility.
It will have an input request, receipt creation service, discount
service.
~~Item list will be from properties file - the idea is if you 
deploy this application you should have the ability to add more 
items without touching the code.~~
~~Holidays and price list will follow the same logic as item list.~~

Brand and types will be enums and tool will be of specific type.
rough draft for testing checkout systems 


Possible updates:
probably making this a global distributed system. idk.
